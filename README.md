## The why behind this project
During my job search, I came across a LinkedIn post describing Intuit's most recent wave of layoffs. While this wouldn't usually catch my eye, what was significant about this instance was the fact that Intuit very publicly described 1,050 out of 1,800 total layoffs as "low performers". Understandably, this led to outrage as (1) these public statements can have detrimental effects on the career of the now unemployed job searcher, (2) low employee performance can be due to many interlaced factors such as poor project management, excessive workloads, unclear direction, etc., and (3) low employee performance can be addressed several time prior to immediate layoff.

Regardless of the questionable management methods of Intuit's recent fumble, layoffs are undoubtably becoming a more and more aggressive cycling season in the tech industry. In order to mitigate the need for aggressive and inhumane layoffs, assessing the natural employee attrition behaviors within a company can aid in mitigating the intensity of layoff cycles. Honest and transparent employee peformance and HR analytics to assess employee attrition is evermore needed to have a good control of the hiring periods for a company, especially in the current corporate climates.
